    - Spread and rest operators (...)
        - Spread: used to split up an array elements OR object properties
            - ex: const newArray = [...oldArray, 1, 2] ==> created new array with the old array items and the two new items
            - ex: const newObject = {...oldObject, newProp:5}
        - Rest: used to merge a list of function arguments into an array    
            - ex: function sortArgs(...args){return args.sort} ==> function recieve a list of arguments turned into an array
    - Destructuring 
        - Easily extract array elements or object properties and store them in variables 
        - Array Destructuring (any variable)
            - ex [a,b] = [''Hello','Max'] ==> assigns a to 'Hello' and b to 'Max'
        - Object Destructuring (key value)
            - {name} = {name:'Max', age:28} ==> assigns name to 'Max'
